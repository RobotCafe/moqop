### About Moqop
[Moqop.com](https://moqop.com) is a design automation platform. 
One of the first functionality is rendering social media content based on athletes' Strava activity. 
The rendering engine can be extended to any design templates using APIs as a data source. 
#### Use cases
- Generate an Instagram story or post based on the athlete's Strava activity
- WIP contains rendering Twitter's Tweets as an image that can be shared on other social media platforms. 
- Idea: Generate ads content via API for any resolution based on dynamic data and generated design templates
